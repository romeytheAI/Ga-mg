## 2025-04-17 - Secure Random Fallbacks and Target Blank Attributes
**Vulnerability:** Weak pseudo-random number generation fallback for UUIDs and potential reverse tabnabbing via target blank without rel noopener.
**Learning:** In frontend web environments, it is common to miss the crypto.getRandomValues API when polyfilling or falling back from crypto.randomUUID. Always check for both.
**Prevention:** Use eslint-plugin-react rules to enforce rel noopener noreferrer on external links. Standardize crypto utilities to prefer Web Crypto API methods before ever relying on Math.random.

## 2025-04-23 - Hardcoded Insecure Default in API Auth Key Verification
**Vulnerability:** The Python webhook API validation logic used a hardcoded fallback value (`default_secret_key`) for its environment variable configuration (`os.getenv("SIDE_CAR_API_KEY", "default_secret_key")`).
**Learning:** This architectural pattern (having an insecure fallback when an environment variable isn't set) creates a dangerous backdoor if the production server environment is ever misconfigured or if `.env` fails to load.
**Prevention:** Always fail securely by throwing an error or halting startup when critical security configurations (like secret keys or passwords) are missing. Do not use default insecure fallbacks in production endpoints.

## 2024-04-24 - Enable Webhook Signature Verifications
**Vulnerability:** Monetization webhooks (Stripe, GitHub Sponsors) had their payload signature verification logic commented out, exposing endpoints to spoofed payloads that could fraudulently skew revenue metrics. Furthermore, missing encoding caused TypeErrors when `hmac.compare_digest` was run.
**Learning:** External webhook handling modules need to ensure production secrets are strictly enforced (`os.getenv` without fallback) and that cryptographic digest comparisons properly encode both arguments.
**Prevention:** Implement automated security scanning to detect commented-out authentication/verification logic and enforce strict typing/byte encoding for Python `hmac` operations.

## 2025-05-24 - PII Leakage in Client-Side Error Handling
**Vulnerability:** Client-side error handling (`ErrorBoundary.tsx` and Firebase error handlers) logged stringified error objects containing PII (emails, auth details) and rendered raw stack traces directly in the UI.
**Learning:** Automatically serializing global user/auth context onto all error objects captures and persists PII in logs, violating privacy and making logs a security liability. Rendering errors directly in the DOM exposes internals to end users.
**Prevention:** Always construct a generic sanitized fallback message for the UI. In centralized loggers, do not append the auth token or PII directly to the error object payload, but instead use arguments correctly (e.g. `console.error(msg, error)`) to preserve the raw error purely for the local console environment without persisting PII strings.
