## 2024-05-18 - Missing ARIA Labels on Icon-Only Buttons
**Learning:** In the project's modals, icon-only buttons (like those using the Lucide `<X>` icon for closing) frequently lack accessible names. This creates barriers for screen reader users who cannot visually determine the button's purpose.
**Action:** Always verify that `<button>` tags containing only `<svg>` or icon components have a descriptive `aria-label` attribute (e.g., `aria-label="Close Modal"`).
